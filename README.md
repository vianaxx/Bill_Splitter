# Bill-Splitting Calculator for a Party

The "Bill-Splitting Calculator for a Party" is a Python script that helps friends easily divide the total bill for a party among themselves. When organizing a gathering, it is often challenging to manage expenses fairly. This script simplifies the process by distributing the costs evenly, considering the option of a "lucky" friend who gets a free pass for their share.

- Key Features:

| Interactive Input: The script interacts with the user, asking for the number of friends attending the party, their names, and the total bill amount.
| Random Lucky Draw: An optional feature allows the program to randomly select one "lucky" friend who won't have to pay anything, lightening the financial load for one person.
| Bill-Splitting Algorithm: The script calculates and divides the remaining bill after the lucky friend's deduction equally among all the participants, ensuring everyone pays a fair share.
| Output Display: The final bill-splitting details are presented in a user-friendly manner, showing the contribution amount for each attendee.

- Technologies Used:

| Python: The entire project is written in Python.
| Random Module: The random module is utilized to select the "lucky" friend randomly from the list of attendees.

- Benefits and Learning:

  This project demonstrates proficiency in Python programming and problem-solving skills in a real-life context. It showcases the ability to handle user inputs, manage data using dictionaries, and perform basic arithmetic calculations. The "lucky" feature illustrates creativity and attention to user experience, making the bill-splitting process more engaging for participants.
