# Bill-Splitting Calculator for a Party

This Python program helps you split a bill among friends for a party. It calculates how much each person needs to contribute towards the total bill, considering whether any participant should be treated as the "lucky" person whose share is covered by others.

## Features

- Accepts the number of friends joining the party and their names.
- Takes the total bill value as input.
- Offers the option to use the "Who is lucky?" feature, which covers the lucky person's share.
- Calculates and distributes the bill amount among friends.
- Displays the distribution of the bill amount for each friend.

## Instructions

1. Run the Python program in a suitable environment that supports Python.
2. The program will prompt you to enter the number of friends joining the party, including yourself.
3. Provide the names of all friends, each on a new line.
4. Enter the total bill value for the party.
5. Choose whether you want to use the "Who is lucky?" feature by typing `Yes` or `No`.
6. If you choose `Yes`, the program will randomly select a lucky friend whose share is covered by others.
7. The program will then calculate and display the bill distribution among all friends.

## Notes

- Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
- The program uses the `random` module to choose a lucky friend.
- If you choose the "Who is lucky?" feature, the lucky friend's share is not considered in the bill distribution.
- If you choose not to use the "Who is lucky?" feature, the bill is evenly distributed among all participants.
- The program rounds the calculated split amounts to two decimal places.
- You can customize the program to suit your needs or modify the output format if desired.
